We want to make a webstie for information about our wedding. We want the website to work on both desktop and mobile devices. We want to include information about the date, location, and schedule of events. We also want to include a photo gallery. The wedding will be in the mountains so we want to have the website reflect that theme. We want to use a color scheme that includes earthy tones and natural colors. In image.png we have included the picture we have used in the wedding invitation card we have sent out to our guests. We want to use that picture on the website as well.
